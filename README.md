# area-finding-robot_hackwestx23
&nbsp;
## W.I.P repository for our HackWesTX: Spring '23 project. A rover that scans, finds, and uploads the area of a given room to a webapp.

#### Our 6-man team participating in this hackathon, designed a rover / tank-style robot operated autonomously by an Arduino UNO. The function is to scan the perimiter of a given room by tracing the walls, and uploading its collected data to create a visual representation of the room based on its corners.

#### * This is an on-going project, * so some of the componenents are not completely functional yet.

## In Progress:
 ### &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Rover Corner Detection: 
 ##### &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  Configuring rover movement to detect a right hand turn and making adjustments if too close to the wall.
 
  ### &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; ngrok and flask integration with ESP8266
 ##### &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Transferring ultrasonic sensor data from ESP8266 into local ngrok server.
